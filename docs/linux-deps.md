### Install python

Most of GNU/Linux distributions already provide an installation of python3 or you can install it via the package manager, for Debian like systems:

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

### Install docker

Official docs: [GNU/Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/)

On Debian or Ubuntu systems, you can `sudo apt-get install docker.io`.

After installing Docker, you might need to re-login to your X session or reboot the machine, so you can get proper permissions to access Docker as a normal user (without sudo).
